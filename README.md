# Customer Segmentation

### Usage

1. Dataset path: `/data/`
2. Run the code given in ipython notebook `customer_segmentation.ipynb`

This repo describe several techniques for clustering, visualizing and interpreting clustering algorithms and output. I explored k-Means as clustering algorithm,  PCA for dimensionality reduction, and applied a variance technique and feature importance to select variables that uniquely represent clusters.
